# Setup:
1. In your directory, run npx create-react-app react-sample-app.
1. This will create a new project and set up our development environment. 
1. Navigate inside react-sample-app.
Create a new component called App.js. We need to do this inside the src directory, so let's run: touch src/App.js.
1. Open the code in your editor.
Explore the app: Open the new scaffolded application and let's observe what's been created.

# Once you're ready to run the server:

1. npm run start
After running npm run start, we can view the app at http://localhost:3000.

1. npx create-react-app provides us with all the necessary tools and configuration necessary to start writing React. npm run start refers to an included script that starts up the development server.
